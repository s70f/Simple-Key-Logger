# Simple-Key-Logger

Logs keys that users are typing in any window. Stealth mode is not included, so main.exe window will be seen. 

## Improvements
 - [ ] Stealth mode - main.exe file is hidden from user view
 - [ ] Use a keyboard hook to monitor keyboard activity instead of using an infinite loop
 - [ ] Log punctuation keys like ",.?;=+"
 - [ ] Log what window the user is typing on
 - [ ] Instead of logging backspace as " [backspace] ", actually delete the letters the user backspaced for easier-to-read logging.
